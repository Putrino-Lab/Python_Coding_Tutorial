# Python Coding Basics Tutorial

A comprehensive Python programming tutorial designed for beginners learning the fundamentals of coding.

## Overview

This project contains interactive Jupyter notebooks that teach essential Python programming concepts through clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on practice problems.

## Topics Covered

### Part 1: Foundation Concepts
- **Variable Types**: Understanding integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- **Library Import**: How to import and use Python libraries effectively
- **NumPy Basics**: Introduction to numerical computing with NumPy
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Setting up matrices for linear algebra operations
  - Working with arrays for data storage
  - Using dictionaries for key-value mappings
  - Understanding hash tables and maps

### Coming Soon
- File I/O operations
- Control flow (for loops, if-else statements)
- Data visualization and plotting
- Statistical analysis and significance testing
- Functions and classes
- Documentation best practices

## Getting Started

1. Open the notebook `python_basics_tutorial.ipynb`
2. Follow along with the explanations and examples
3. Complete the practice problems in each section
4. Run the code cells to see the results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NumPy library

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy jupyter math datetime scipy collections matplotlib seaborn pandas warnings
```

## Usage

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the tutorial:

```bash
jupyter notebook python_basics_tutorial.ipynb
```

## Learning Approach

Each topic follows this structure:
1. **Brief Explanation**: 2-3 sentences explaining the concept
2. **Practical Example**: Working code demonstrating the concept
3. **Practice Problem**: Hands-on exercise with guided completion

This approach ensures you understand both the theory and practical application of each concept.
